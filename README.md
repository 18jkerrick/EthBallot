This is a voting ballot that is completely run on the ethereum blockchain. In order for a vote to count, 
the voter must pay 0.1 ether to the chairman, the creator of the ballot, along with their vote. Once the 
first vote on the ballot is confirmed on the blockchain, there is a 24 hour window for votes to come in. 
Any vote after the 24 hour period will fail to confirm and not be counted. The winner will be revealed 
once the ballot is closed!
